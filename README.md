Common problems and its solution on c# Based on Steve Yegge's post 7 code problems 
https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions

1. Function to reverse a string
2. Function to compute Nth fibonacci number
3. Print out the grade-school multiplication table up to 12x12
4. Write a functions that sums up integers from a text file, one int per line
5. Write a function to print on the odd numbers from 1 to 99
6. Find the larges int value in an int array
7. Format an RBG value (three 1-byte numbers) as a 6-digits hexadecimal string

I will add more problems if needed

The solution includes a Console aplication proyect (Main), a Library Project (Core) and a Core.Tests project, the purpose remains in the name.
The 'Core' project includes one main folder per exercise to better organization, for the purpose of the project is OK but I understand that organize folder names for funcionality  in that way is not the best practice.

NUnit and NUnit test adapter is included on the test project just for fun and practice. In addition to the solution I will include more than one solution if is necessary for check what is the best performance with single of multiple solutions the main project is just for run the comparision  and check it on console.
